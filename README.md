# HigherMe Forms
This is a simple app with two forms built using React/Redux. The app simulates
an API call and save the information entered by the user in the Redux global
state

### What's missing?
- Data validation: currently the app accepts the user data, but does not
perform validation; in a production app, the data should be validated.
- Error handling: because there are no real API calls, there is no error
handling routine in the app; in production that would also be necessary
- Test: Unit and integration tests were also not included to keep the app
simple, and produce its main task

## Running the app
1. Clone or download the repo
2. In terminal/command line, navigate to repo's directory
3. Run "npm install"
4. Once the previous command is completed, run "npm start"
